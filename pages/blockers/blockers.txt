1. bad wifi
===========
    Description: wifi is essential for Rack Recieving responsibilities (ex. Boost Workflow) but there are various
    times a depended on network could be malfunctioning for you. Its best to know some work-arounds to continue tasking. 

    Note:   a little network-troubleshooting can often fix connection issues on our main network, but be mindful of the time
            spent. If a quick run through basic solutions does not fix the problem, move to a differnt network

    a. Network troubleshooting
        1. Disconnect & forget network ssid, then reconnect
        2. Enable then disable airplane mode
        3. Restart computer
        4. Flush DNS cache then reset ip 
    
    b. alt connections
        WPA - site network access

    c. wifi hotspot
        Your poc should have a wifi hotspot at times of network outage. Ask for the Network SSID name and password
        to connect your laptop to.

    d. no wifi
        If there are no wifi networks or hotspot access, get with your manager for a solution.
