          Parts like BBU's sometimes find their way into the custody of Rack
          Receiving personel (usually when bbu problems happen in boost). When
          this happens they can not be used in racks where they are needed. Its
          best to clear any of these out, and can be done using Mobility. This
          video goes through the process of checking custody in Mobility for any
          parts that may appear and removing them using the removal tools also
          in Mobility
