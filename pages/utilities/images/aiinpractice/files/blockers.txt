WE (ID Rack Recieving) are fire fighters, i am getting mentally exhausted being a fire fighter,

What this means to me within ID-RR is I notice repeated practices keeping us in a state constantly reactionary to problems consistantly reappearing, generating improvised momentary motions that produce back-logged work costing unessessary efforts. 
These inefficient motions pile up constantly and seem to only be tackled with brute force head-count methods instead of repairing structural disadvantages. 



Blockers:
Privlaged POC's - 
Loss Leads - wasted redundant efforts, doing things autonomy could fix
VADs - not on time, truck/dock capacity, excessive reload time
Security - delay everything, minimize contact
Prep fail - not enough prep for racks 
wrong romp - romp not ready rejections, wasted money
staffing fails - inconsistant unreliable swaps, time consuming allocation, loss of proficiency 

Fixes:
Potent POC's - training, POC's guide to success because they are responsible for it
2truck rule - as many racks as 2 trucks can hold
autonomy - sites print own labels, get own manifest, responsible for operation standards
prep standards - always at least 15 rack-ready-rule
capacity - aws sends racks that can be excepted
Learn to Serve - POC's swap to assisting other site needs (tools, supplies, water)


 this is what we need to do to function optimally  
 
 onboard new employees, monitor management messages, loss of efficiency
