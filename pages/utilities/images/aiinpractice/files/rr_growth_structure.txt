Rack Receiving Structure of Operation - (this can be packaged and utilyzed at other sites)


[Growth	from AUTONOMY]:  Here-There-Ladder perspective

I.		Quarterly Review
		1.	Metrics to show progress
			- Quantity of issues
			- RR performance(racks and completion timeframes) vs previous 
			- Rejected racks
			- Technician feedback
			- Vads feedback
			
		2.	Role Testing Timeframes
			- When to test to next technician responsibility level mastery
		
II.		Invest in Support
		1.	Level Related Suggestions
			- As techs practice responsibilities they gain efficiencies 
			- Form to submit suggestions for current Level responsibility improvements  
	
III.	Floor Operations Progression System 
		1.	L1 Prep: 
			- Prep standards - always at least 15 rack-ready-rule
			- Focus on relatability of hardware and incomeing racks(quick numbers)
			- Ingesting equipment
			- Organization of unboxing supplies
			- Supply upkeep
			- Organization of dock RR readiness
			- Dock floor tidyness 
			- L1 test to L2
	
		2.	L2 Rack Assemble RTF:
			- L1 float
			- Throwing whips & Scanning into Boost
			- Visual rack inspection
			- Tor Patching
			- Safety of handling equipment
			- Training L1 - training guides to success because they are responsible for it
			- L2 test to L3

		3.	L3 Issues Handling
			- L2 float
			- Sites print own labels, get own manifest, responsible for operation standards
			- Ticket handling/creation 
			- Escalation
			- Training L2 - training guides to success because they are responsible for it
			- Learn to Serve - swap to assisting other site needs (tools, supplies, water)
			- RR Standards Mastery Test
	
		4.	Mastery of L1-L3 priorities
			- Special projects 
			- Growth oportunities

 
[Reliability from TRANSPARENCY]: Duty Detial are in Scope

I.		Access to Information within Scope of Responsibility
		- techs should be comfortable with getting the items/details they need for their role without escalation 

II.		Training How to Gather Information within Scope of Responsibility
		- techs should be given full disclosure of how to get the items/details they need for their role without escalation


[Confidence	from STANDARDS]: Documentaioanlly Backed Canfidence to Act 

I.		Issue Resolution External: team is confident to act externally when backed by documentation
		1.	Cooperation with other teams - (is rarely smooth due to control of juristiction of duties directly reflecting each teams performance)
			- Standards on interaction with other team responsibilities bleeding into RR's
			- How to escalate details
			
II.		Issue Resolution Internal: team is confident to act internally when backed by documentation
		1.	Dissagreements on how a task should be performed 
			- Standards for daily tasks in each role
			- How to escalate details


[UNLIKELY REQUESTS]: to accomplish standard "control group" performance monitoring:

I.		Capacity Quantity Restraints
		- As many racks as 2 trucks can hold per site
		
II.		Capacity Quality Restraints
		- AWS only sends racks that can be excepted
